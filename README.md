This is the fork of Mink's DriverTestsuite library that supports PHP `>=7.2`, Symfony `^4.4` and `^5.0` and PHPUnit `^8.0`.

For the documentation, please [refer to the original repository](https://github.com/minkphp/driver-testsuite).

No updates other than Symfony compatibility will be provided, but this fork _might_ be synchronised with the original repository in the future.
